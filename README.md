# CanvasMusic

A web app designed to fetch data from Spotify (and later on implementing the LastFM API) to visualize user listening habits. Plans for top artists, top songs, top genres and in specific time periods.

## What is already implemented

  * Spotify log in via Implicit Grant Flow.
  * Returning to the app page with the auth token granted.
  * Fetching top artists data and logging them.

#### This repo doesn't have the API key. So it won't work if cloned unless you get your own Spotify API key.
