# CanvasMusic

A web app designed to fetch data from Spotify (and later on implementing the LastFM API) to visualize user listening habits. Plans for top artists, top songs, top genres and in specific time periods.

## What is already implemented

  * Spotify log in via Implicit Grant Flow.
  * Returning to the app page with the auth token granted.
  * Fetching top artists data and logging them.
  * Basis of material UI

## What to do
  * Adding parameters while fetching top artists (i.e longevity of data, size of the image collage)
  * Creating an image collage with the top artists image + name of a user specified size
  * Adding top musical genres component
  * Adding top tracks component
  * Implementing UI with the Material UI library.

#### This repo doesn't have the API key. So it won't work if cloned unless you get your own Spotify API key.
